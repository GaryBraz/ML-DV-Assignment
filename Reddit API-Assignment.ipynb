However, the amount of tax relief you can get on your pension contributions depends on your age and income. The table below shows the percentage of your earnings that you can contribute to a pension and get tax relief, up to a maximum of €115,000 per year⁴.\n",

      "A private pension is a personal contract between you and a pension provider, such as an insurance company or an investment firm. There are two main types of private pensions: Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) and Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs). Both of them allow you to invest your pension fund in various assets, such as shares, property, bonds and cash, and to withdraw a tax-free lump sum of up to 25% (up to a maximum of €200,000) when you retire¹. The main difference between them is that PRSAs have capped charges and limited investment options, while RACs have variable charges and more investment choices².\n",

I’ve decided to do as much as I can myself to cut costs. It’s tough going and we are 1 year into the build and looking like we will get the extra bedrooms in early December. The one thing you don’t provide in your post is how far from you current cottage you’d have to move to the new house. Moving just 500 meters from your current location could have a huge impact on your family’s live. It could be positive or negative. But you won’t know until your kids are teenagers.  My neighbour who’s is a wise man laughs at what im doing and keeps reminding me that the chaos of the young  family is a short period of time that passes quickly. His advice was to push trough the difficult years when there young and you’ll have plenty of room when things settle down. I’m beginning to  believe he’s right.

You’re going to be on the hook for it if you get caught so you won’t be able to do the reduced cash price you just can’t. My advice would be not to take that risk of not declaring it anyway. If it’s only small jobs people should be throwing cash at you as they want the job done cheaper simple as that. \n",

Why would they bother at the moment when they just put in their price and the customer can take it or leave it? They are not stuck for work. I used to have a mate that would let me order tools on his account and pay him ex vat. He won’t let people do it anymore, people are tightening things up. Since the moneys gone up more people seem to be being audited according to his explanation. I’d kill to have a plumbing contact that would do small cash jobs for me. The only people that wouldn’t understand this are non homeowners etc. that have never had to cold call a plumber and get cracked good to fix a small leak etc.\n",

A thing U could do is try get out of debt quicker & overpay monthly on ur mortgage as it will knock years & tens of thousands in interest off.

How is you giving them 30k going to get the other party off the mortgage & deed? It's coincidental if that is the max lend he qualifies for on his own & the amount they need to pay the other party, ur post is unclear. However, his current bank may let him take over the loan, I do these all the time and mostly, they do not meet affordability and I do it as an exception based on the best interests of the customer. However, I would need to see him paying the mortgage alone, without contributions from the other party or evidence of financial strain for at least 6 months & a letter from the exes solicitor stating they will accept 30k as full & final settlement for their interests in the property. An issue arises here with ur loan....they will want to know where the 30k is coming from & if it's a loan, it will reduce his max lend & affordability. A way around that is for him to have a family member do a gift letter but U would need to transfer the funds to the family member & they need to transfer to ur friend,so messy. Will the ex accept monthly payments? If they can afford to pay the mortgage & pay U 500, they can get a Ukrainian in to a spare room for 800pm tax free....or move into box room & rent master to a couple for more money...then they could pay ex min 1500pm.
